# Return to the Source: Four Pillars Professional Portfolios

## Dr. Nashilongweshipwe Mushaandja
### The Theoretical Architect & Cultural Methodologist

**Core Identity:** Distinguished scholar-artist whose groundbreaking theoretical frameworks transform indigenous knowledge systems into sophisticated decolonial methodologies for contemporary cultural practice.

**Professional Foundation:**
Dr. Mushaandja serves as a Lecturer in Drama and Theatre Arts at the University of Namibia, where his role extends far beyond traditional academic boundaries. Born in Katutura, Namibia in 1987, he embodies a deliberate choice to remain rooted in his homeland while engaging with international scholarly conversations. His educational journey from the University of Namibia through the University of Witwatersrand to earning his PhD in Performance Studies from the University of Cape Town reflects a deep commitment to building intellectual capacity within African institutions.

**Revolutionary Theoretical Contributions:**
His most significant innovation lies in theorizing "Oudano" (Uudhano/Ouvano), an indigenous Ovahimba concept of performance that he has developed into a sophisticated decolonial methodology. This framework positions Oudano as an "archival container" where indigenous knowledge systems are preserved, transmitted, and continuously reinterpreted. Through his concept of "Archival F(r)ictions," he creates deliberate tensions between established archival materials and contemporary performance, revealing how dominant historical narratives silence marginalized experiences while giving agency to overlooked archives such as the land itself, oral traditions, and embodied memories.

**Artistic Practice as Research:**
His band project Tschuku Tschuku employs "sonic formation" to create contemporary musical interpretations of historical sound archives, emphasizing active reinterpretation over static preservation. Performance projects like "Ondaanisa Yo Pomudhime" ("Dance of the Rubber Tree") serve as critical interventions in traditional institutional spaces. His internationally recognized work "ZILIN: for the first and future African sonic stars" received the Zürcher Kantonalbank Public Choice Award in 2021, demonstrating his ability to create work with both local resonance and global recognition.

**Community-Centered Pedagogy:**
Through "Operation Odalate Naiteke" ("the fence must break") in Katutura, Windhoek, Mushaandja creates spaces for radical learning inspired by Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy. He advocates for embodied learning that promotes critical consciousness through participatory dialogue and creative expression, ensuring that decolonial theory translates into practical community empowerment.

**RTS Integration:**
Within Return to the Source, Dr. Mushaandja serves as the theoretical anchor, leading sessions that link archives to embodied practice. He fundamentally expanded participants' understanding of archives beyond paper documents to include performance, embodied memory, song, dance, and place itself. His approach transforms how filmmakers view their medium—shifting from merely recording reality to practicing accountability to memory. He positions RTS as "part of building African institutions of memory," advocating that funders and festivals must support these processes of remembering and making together if they genuinely wish to engage with Africa.

**Philosophical Foundation:**
Operating from "optimistic realism," Mushaandja acknowledges systemic oppression while maintaining unwavering faith in the transformative potential of creative practice. His identification with "Life Goes On" represents an act of radical self-determination, focusing on present-moment transformation rather than distant utopian goals. He remains committed to continuous critique and transformation, arguing that any normalized practice requires fresh interrogation.

## Fibby Kioria
### The Strategic Producer & Capacity Development Architect

**Core Identity:** Visionary producer and cultural strategist who systematically empowers African narrative sovereignty through innovative infrastructure development and sustainable capacity-building methodologies.

**Professional Excellence:**
As Founder and CEO of Mucii Pictures, established in 2022, Kioria manages comprehensive year-long development programs for emerging filmmakers from Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda. Her co-founding of Manyatta Screenings (an online and outdoor short film festival in Kenya) and the East African Screen Collective (EASC) demonstrates her commitment to building continental networks that advocate for narrative sovereignty in screen-based sectors.

**Proven Funding and Program Management:**
Kioria's expertise in managing substantial international funding programs is exemplified by her role as project manager for the DW Akademie Film Development Fund, where she successfully oversaw €227,000 across Eastern Africa. Her methodology ensures that communities identify their existing storytelling traditions and cultural knowledge, then receive professional training to express that knowledge through contemporary creative techniques while maintaining complete ownership of their cultural narratives.

**Infrastructure Innovation:**
Through EASC, she helped establish the EAccelerate Fund, providing grants and comprehensive mentorship for creative practitioners from concept to market access. In early 2025, she launched the African Film Festivals Platform in collaboration with Creative Africa Lab and Luxor African Film—a centralized directory addressing critical information gaps for African creative practitioners seeking international opportunities. This infrastructure work ensures that international partnerships build permanent local capacity rather than temporary project completions.

**Cross-Cultural Collaboration Mastery:**
Kioria's establishment of Mucii Farmhouse, an artist residency in the Kenyan savanna, serves as an ongoing laboratory for cross-cultural creative collaboration while prioritizing capacity building for local participants. Her approach creates productive creative environments for sensitive cultural material without compromising local agency, ensuring that visiting artists contribute technical skills while local participants retain complete ownership of their cultural narratives.

**RTS Co-Creation:**
As co-founder and co-organizer of Return to the Source alongside Perivi Katjavivi, Kioria designed RTS as a deliberate counterpoint to donor-driven models, emphasizing African autonomy and responsive design. The lab's structure combined historical site visits, oral testimony, masterclasses, outdoor screenings, and collaborative filmmaking in Ovitoto, engaging directly with sites of colonial history and trauma. Kioria emphasized designing a lab that listens to African needs rather than external donor directives, creating spaces where filmmakers can "dream," "ideate," and "marinate" with stories without immediate market pressure.

**Continental Network Leadership:**
Her board positions across Uganda, Nigeria, and Kenya, combined with extensive work across multiple African countries, establish her as a key continental connector. Through international selection committees at Hot Docs, Chicken & Egg Films, and Locarno Open Doors, she advocates for African projects within global funding and distribution networks while focusing on making these opportunities accessible continent-wide.

**Mentorship Excellence:**
As lead mentor for the Durban International Film Festival's 2025 residency program, Kioria designs comprehensive programs strengthening local capacity while building continental and international networks for festival directors across South Africa. Her collaboration on the Future Mentors Program through Durban Film Mart develops systematic mentorship methodologies that empower participants to strengthen their own local festivals.

## Perivi Katjavivi
### The Visionary Filmmaker & Historical Narrative Specialist

**Core Identity:** Pioneering filmmaker and cultural historian whose innovative exploration of African identity and historical inquiry positions him at the forefront of African narrative sovereignty and authentic storytelling.

**Filmmaking Excellence:**
As Founder of Old Location Films, Katjavivi has established himself as a visionary creator dedicated to African-centered films, documentaries, and television series. His feature film "Under the Hanging Tree" (2023) holds the historic distinction of being Namibia's first-ever submission to the Academy Awards® for Best International Feature Film. This groundbreaking work blends Herero mysticism, proverbs, and mythology with contemporary genre storytelling, earning two major awards at the Africa Movie Academy Awards (AMAA), including Best Editing.

**Comprehensive Creative Mastery:**
Katjavivi's creative expertise spans the entire filmmaking spectrum—director, writer, producer, cinematographer, and editor. His diverse portfolio includes "Film Festival Film" (2019), which premiered at the Berlinale, "Emoyeni: Nsanguluko" (2018), a four-part Netflix series that won three SAFTAs (South African Film and Television Awards), and "The Unseen" (2016), which won Best Film at the Innsbruck International Film Festival. His ambitious vision for Namibian cinema includes "Winning an Oscar," reflecting his commitment to elevating African storytelling to global recognition.

**Academic and Cultural Grounding:**
With a BA in Cinema from Columbia College Hollywood and an MA in African Cinema from the University of Cape Town, where his research focused on reshaping post-colonial narratives through Namibian cinema, Katjavivi combines theoretical depth with practical expertise. Currently pursuing a PhD in History at the University of the Western Cape, his research on colonial memory sites related to the Herero genocide directly informs his filmmaking practice.

**Strategic Cultural Positioning:**
His bicultural heritage—born in Oxford to a Namibian political leader and British mother—provides strategic advantages in navigating both African storytelling traditions and international film markets. This positioning enables him to serve as a cultural bridge while maintaining authentic African perspectives. As a licensed Anglican lay minister and educator at the University of Namibia, he brings spiritual and pedagogical dimensions to his cultural work.

**RTS Vision and Leadership:**
Katjavivi co-conceived and co-organized Return to the Source as an explicit "counterpoint to donor-driven models," emphasizing African autonomy and locally responsive design. Located in Ovitoto, Namibia—a rural area deeply connected to his family history where his great-aunt, a genocide survivor, found refuge—RTS uses film as a tool to exorcise trauma, reclaim embodied histories, and confront colonial legacies. His vision focused on "dreaming about what an African lab looks like when there's no donor telling us we've got to train poor kids in Africa," instead "listening to ourselves, listening to the ground, listening to what really matters to us."

**Innovative Methodology:**
The RTS program methodology blends historical site visits, oral testimony from local historians and elders, masterclasses, outdoor screenings, and collaborative filmmaking. Katjavivi facilitated sessions on African film genres, alternative epistemologies, and "Making 'Under the Hanging Tree,' Centring Oral Histories in Narratives." This approach deliberately departs from market-oriented logic, providing space to "imagine and to think," "ideate, to marinate" with stories without immediate commercial pressure.

**Regional Development Vision:**
Katjavivi's proposal for Africa's first specialized training center for historical narrative cinema addresses a critical market gap and growing global demand for authentic African narratives. While based in Namibia, his vision serves the broader Southern African region, fostering sustainable creative capacity and regional industry development.
