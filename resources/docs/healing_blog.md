# When Filmmakers Heal History: How a Namibian Lab Rewrote the Rules of African Cinema

There exists a profound tension in contemporary African cinema—one that threads through funding structures, festival circuits, and the very conception of what constitutes "development" in filmmaking. The document detailing Return to the Source: Pan-African Film Lab & Residency illuminates this tension with remarkable clarity, revealing how a single residency in Namibia managed to propose an entirely different vocabulary for cultural exchange, historical reckoning, and artistic practice.

## The Architecture of Alternative Learning

What strikes me most powerfully about Return to the Source is its fundamental rejection of the extractive model that has long characterized African film development programs. Traditional labs operate like sophisticated mining operations: they identify talent, extract it from local contexts, refine it according to international market standards, and export it to global circuits. The residency, organized by Perivi Katjavivi and Fibby Kioria, inverted this paradigm entirely.

Consider the deliberate choice to begin not in a classroom but at Ovitoto, amidst the landscapes where German colonial forces perpetrated genocide against the Herero and Nama peoples between 1904 and 1908. This was not scenic backdrop but active pedagogy—what performance scholar Dr. Nashilongweshipwe Mushaandja aptly termed treating "landscape itself as archive." The very ground became both text and teacher, demanding that participants reckon with how cinema might serve memory rather than merely document reality.

The presence of a therapist, the integration of coloring sessions, the emphasis on collective editing—these elements signal a recognition that trauma-informed practice cannot be an afterthought in cultural work. When Tanzanian filmmaker Cece Mlay observed that "the triggers can shape the course of your career," she was articulating something profound about how personal and historical wounds intersect with artistic practice. The residency created what we might call a container—strong enough to hold difficult histories, porous enough to allow transformation.

## Restitution as Creative Practice

The timing of this residency cannot be understood apart from the broader dynamics of restitution between Germany and Namibia. The 2021 acknowledgment of genocide and pledge of €1.1 billion in development aid represents a particular kind of institutional response—one that, as the document notes, has been widely criticized for excluding affected communities from negotiations and structuring payments as development aid rather than reparations.

Return to the Source operated in the liminal space created by this inadequate official response. By bringing German institutions like the Goethe-Institut and representatives from Dresden State Art Collections into direct dialogue with Namibian communities and African filmmakers, the residency enacted a different model of accountability. Rather than state-to-state negotiations conducted over the heads of affected communities, this was cultural work that centered community voices, oral histories, and embodied knowledge.

The participant reflections reveal how powerfully this approach resonated. When Ethiopian filmmaker Hiwot Admasu described feeling like "an outsider" due to Ethiopia's different colonial history, she was articulating something crucial about how diverse African experiences with colonialism create different relationships to these histories. The residency held space for that complexity rather than flattening it into a single narrative of African victimization or resistance.

## The Economics of Attention

What becomes clear through the detailed participant accounts is that Return to the Source was practicing what we might call an economics of attention fundamentally different from market-oriented labs. Where programs like Talents Durban or Ouaga Film Lab emphasize pitching skills and international co-production readiness, RTS asked participants to attend to landscape, to elders, to the material traces of historical violence inscribed in the physical environment.

This shift from product to process, from market preparation to community engagement, represents more than a pedagogical choice. It signals a different understanding of what African cinema might be for. As Kenyan participant Saitabao Kaiyare reflected, the residency was about "returning to your history, your identity, who you are, and understanding the complexity of our history." This is cultural work that cannot be measured by traditional industry metrics but may be far more essential to the long-term sustainability of African creative expression.

The collective editing sessions supervised by Khalid Shamis particularly intrigue me. The "letting go of authorship" that he described represents a profound challenge to the individualistic creative models that dominate global film culture. In a context where intellectual property and individual creative ownership are increasingly central to how films are financed and distributed, RTS was experimenting with more collective approaches to storytelling—approaches that may be more aligned with African cultural traditions but are certainly at odds with contemporary industry practice.

## Institutional Adaptation and the Question of Sustainability

The involvement of European institutions in Return to the Source raises fascinating questions about how cultural diplomacy might evolve in response to growing demands for restitution and reparations. The Mastercard Enablement Programme's funding through Berlinale, the participation of the Goethe-Institut, and the presence of German museum directors suggest that some European institutions are beginning to experiment with different models of engagement.

Yet the sustainability question looms large. As co-founder Fibby Kioria noted, "When I left the lab, I broke down on the plane... It was heavy, unlike anything I've experienced." The emotional and psychological labor of holding space for collective processing of historical trauma cannot be underestimated. The residency model demands a level of care and attention that is resource-intensive in ways that traditional skills-based training is not.

The expansion plans mentioned—conversations with Cape Verde, Madagascar, and continued work in Namibia—suggest that the organizers are thinking beyond a single intervention. But scaling this model while maintaining its depth and community rootedness presents genuine challenges. How do you systematize the kind of organic, relationship-based learning that characterized the Namibia residency?

## The Ripple Effects

Perhaps most intriguing are the ways participants describe carrying the residency's impact forward into their ongoing work. Namibian actor Justin Hango's project on gender-based violence, Esther Buekes's new role as chairperson of the Namibia Film Commission, and the general sense of participants becoming "ambassadors" for this approach suggest that Return to the Source succeeded in creating lasting change rather than merely providing temporary exposure.

This raises important questions about how we measure the success of cultural interventions. Traditional metrics—films completed, festival selections, international co-productions secured—would likely miss the deeper transformations that participants describe. The residency seems to have operated more like a catalyst, creating conditions for ongoing transformation rather than delivering discrete outcomes.

## Toward a Different Infrastructure

What Return to the Source ultimately proposes is not the replacement of market-oriented film development programs but the creation of complementary infrastructure. African cinema, like any healthy ecosystem, requires diversity—spaces for international market preparation alongside spaces for community engagement, history processing, and cultural memory work.

The residency model suggests that sustainable African film infrastructure might need to embrace what we could call "non-productive productivity"—forms of cultural work that generate value in ways that are difficult to quantify but may be essential to the long-term flourishing of African creative expression. This is work that builds cultural sovereignty from the ground up rather than seeking integration into existing global hierarchies.

As we consider the future of cultural exchange in an era of increasing attention to colonial legacies and demands for reparations, Return to the Source offers a compelling model. It demonstrates that meaningful cultural collaboration requires more than good intentions or financial support. It demands a willingness to be changed by the encounter, to allow community voices to set the terms of engagement, and to recognize that the process of cultural exchange may be more important than any particular product it generates.

The residency's emphasis on collective healing through creative practice points toward possibilities for cultural work that serves communities first and markets second. In an era when the extractive dynamics of global cultural industries are increasingly visible and contested, such experiments feel not merely valuable but necessary. They suggest pathways toward forms of cultural exchange that honor the complexity of historical relationships while creating space for new forms of creative and community expression to emerge.
