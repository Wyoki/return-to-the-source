In the unforgiving landscape of central Namibia, where acacia thorns catch the desert wind and red earth stretches toward infinite horizons, stands a tree that has witnessed the unthinkable. The hanging tree of Ovitoto—gnarled, weathered, yet defiantly alive—served as the gallows where German colonial forces executed Herero and Nama people during the genocidal campaigns of 1904-1908. Today, this same tree has become the spiritual and narrative heart of Namibia's first-ever Academy Award submission.

The metamorphosis of "Under the Hanging Tree" from a community workshop exercise into an internationally acclaimed short film represents far more than a singular artistic triumph. It illuminates a revolutionary approach to African filmmaking—one that treats landscape as living archive, community as collaborator, and historical trauma as a source of both pain and profound healing.

## The Sacred Wound of Ovitoto

To understand the significance of this film, one must first grasp the weight of its birthplace. Ovitoto exists as both geographical location and psychological landscape, a small town in Namibia's Otjozondjupa region built upon layers of colonial violence. The German forces who established the Ovitoto mission station in the early 1900s transformed it into a site of systematic brutality, where indigenous resistance was met with execution beneath the branches of what would become known as the hanging tree.

When the organizers of Return to the Source's inaugural Pan-African Film Lab chose Ovitoto in October 2023, they were making a profound statement about the relationship between place and storytelling. This was not simply location scouting—it was an act of cultural archaeology, an attempt to excavate meaning from soil soaked in ancestral blood.

Director Perivi Katjavivi, a Namibian filmmaker and doctoral candidate at the University of the Western Cape, understood this immediately. "We didn't choose Ovitoto for its scenery," she reflects. "We chose it because the land itself is a character in our story. Every grain of sand holds memory. Every shadow cast by that tree carries the weight of history."

## The Alchemy of Community Creation

The workshop that birthed "Under the Hanging Tree" operated on principles that challenge conventional film education. Rather than imposing predetermined curricula upon twelve filmmakers from Namibia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania, the residency functioned as an exercise in collective learning. Local elders and community members didn't merely provide color commentary—they became co-creators of the educational experience itself.

This approach reflected a deeper understanding of trauma-informed cultural production. The presence of a registered counselor throughout the five-day intensive wasn't merely precautionary—it was foundational. Working with material as sensitive as colonial genocide requires psychological infrastructure that can hold both the pain of historical memory and the possibility of creative transformation.

Dr. Nashilongweshipwe Mushaandja, who facilitated sessions on landscape as archive, helped participants understand how geography itself functions as a repository of cultural memory. Under her guidance, the filmmakers learned to read the environment as a text, interpreting the stories written in stone formations, tree rings, and the very air that moved across consecrated ground.

## From Tree to Screen: The Artistic Process

The creation of "Under the Hanging Tree" demonstrates how constraints can become creative catalysts. Working with a skeleton crew over just three days, Katjavivi faced the challenge of creating something meaningful within severe limitations. The solution emerged from the landscape itself: the hanging tree would serve not as mere backdrop but as the film's central character and organizing principle.

The resulting work defies easy categorization. Blending documentary footage of the actual memorial tree with carefully crafted narrative sequences, the film creates what might be called "archaeological cinema"—storytelling that excavates the layers of meaning embedded in specific places. The camera becomes a tool for witnessing, moving between past and present with the fluidity of memory itself.

The film's meditative pace reflects its deeper purposes. This is not entertainment in the conventional sense but rather an invitation to contemplation, a space for audiences to sit with difficult histories and consider their ongoing reverberations. The tree's survival becomes a metaphor for cultural resilience—despite the violence it has witnessed, it continues to reach toward light.

## The Festival Circuit as Cultural Bridge

The journey from Ovitoto workshop to international recognition reveals how festival circuits can function as cultural translation systems. Each screening context brought new dimensions to the film's meaning, demonstrating how local stories can achieve universal resonance without sacrificing their specificity.

The film's premiere at the Namibia Film Festival in November 2023 established its domestic significance, earning the Best Short Film award and validating the community-based production model. This local recognition provided the foundation for international expansion, proving that authentic local stories often possess the strongest global appeal.

At the Berlin International Film Festival's Panorama section, "Under the Hanging Tree" encountered European audiences grappling with their own colonial histories. The film's unflinching examination of German colonial violence created uncomfortable but necessary conversations about historical accountability and contemporary reparations.

In Durban, the film connected with South African filmmakers exploring similar themes of memory and reconciliation, building networks of solidarity across national boundaries. At the Ouagadougou Panafrican Film and Television Festival, it joined a broader conversation about decolonizing African cinema and asserting cultural sovereignty through storytelling.

Each festival screening functioned as a form of cultural diplomacy, with the film serving as an ambassador for Namibian perspectives on history, trauma, and healing. The international attention validated not just the film itself but the broader project of African self-representation in global cultural spaces.

## The Oscar Campaign: Strategic Vision Meets Cultural Mission

The decision to submit "Under the Hanging Tree" for Academy Award consideration required careful navigation of both artistic and institutional considerations. For a nation that had never submitted a film to the Oscars, the process involved more than simply meeting technical requirements—it demanded the creation of entirely new infrastructure for international cultural engagement.

Katjavivi's approach to the campaign reflected the same principles that guided the film's creation. "This wasn't about chasing Hollywood validation," she emphasizes. "It was about putting Namibian stories on the global stage, showing that our narratives deserve international attention on their own terms, not as exotic curiosities but as essential human experiences."

The submission process required coordination between multiple institutions: the Namibia Film Commission provided crucial support and official approval, while international partners helped navigate the complex requirements of Academy submission. The preparation of English subtitles and marketing materials had to balance accessibility with cultural authenticity, ensuring that translation didn't diminish the film's specific cultural resonances.

## Ripple Effects: Transforming an Industry

The impact of Namibia's first Oscar submission extends far beyond the individual recognition of "Under the Hanging Tree." It has fundamentally altered the landscape of possibilities for Namibian filmmakers, demonstrating that local stories can compete on the world's most prestigious stages.

Esther Buekes, chairperson of the Namibia Film Commission, describes the submission as "a watershed moment for our industry." The phrase carries particular weight in a country where water is precious—a watershed doesn't just mark geographical boundaries but creates the conditions for life itself.

Young Namibian filmmakers now have a template for international success that doesn't require abandoning their cultural roots. Film schools across the country report increased enrollment, while funding organizations express new interest in supporting local productions. The film has proved that community-based, trauma-informed production methods can generate not just personal healing but professional opportunities.

International co-producers and distributors have begun reaching out to Namibian filmmakers, creating new pathways for collaboration that center African perspectives rather than marginalizing them. This shift represents a fundamental change in power dynamics, with Namibian creators now able to negotiate from a position of proven excellence rather than peripheral curiosity.

## Lessons for the Continent: A New Model of African Cinema

The success of "Under the Hanging Tree" offers a replicable model for African filmmakers seeking to balance local authenticity with international appeal. The film demonstrates how trauma-informed production methods can create both artistic excellence and community healing, suggesting that the process of filmmaking can be as transformative as its final products.

The principle of location as methodology—choosing filming sites based on their historical and cultural significance rather than visual appeal—opens new possibilities for storytelling that engages seriously with African histories. When landscape becomes character rather than mere backdrop, films gain depth and authenticity that resonate with both local and global audiences.

The integration of community voices throughout the production process ensures cultural accuracy while creating opportunities for mutual learning. Elders and community members aren't simply interviewed subjects but active collaborators in shaping both the story and its telling.

Most importantly, the film proves that addressing historical trauma through artistic practice can generate healing without sacrificing artistic rigor. The presence of psychological support throughout production creates conditions where difficult material can be explored safely, allowing for both personal growth and cultural processing of collective wounds.

## Looking Forward: Seeds of Future Growth

As Katjavivi develops her first feature film, continuing to explore themes of memory and reconciliation, she carries forward the lessons learned in Ovitoto. The hanging tree that inspired her Oscar-submitted short film continues to stand as both memorial and metaphor—a reminder that even in places of great suffering, new life can emerge and flourish.

The Namibia Film Commission reports unprecedented international interest in local productions, with multiple co-production agreements under negotiation. Film festivals across Africa are implementing similar community-based residency programs, spreading the model pioneered by Return to the Source.

Perhaps most significantly, the success has inspired a new generation of African filmmakers to see international recognition not as validation from outside but as amplification of stories that already possess inherent worth. The journey from Ovitoto to Oscar demonstrates that African cinema doesn't need to conform to external expectations to achieve global success—it needs only to tell its own stories with honesty, skill, and profound respect for the communities from which they emerge.

The hanging tree of Ovitoto continues to stand against the Namibian sky, its branches reaching toward light despite the darkness it has witnessed. In the same way, Namibian cinema is growing from roots planted in difficult soil, stretching toward international recognition while remaining firmly grounded in the cultural earth that gives it meaning.

This is the true triumph of "Under the Hanging Tree"—not simply that it reached the Academy Awards, but that it proved African stories, told by African voices with African methods, can flourish on any stage without losing their essential character. The tree has become a forest, and the forest is just beginning to grow.
